Feature: Multiplayer - Turn based
In order to get the feature working, I added a turn indidator for the users. Players take turns flipping cards and the JS code keeps track of whose turn it is. If the match is successful the turn does not change. Both players have a visible score counter and when all cards are matched, scores are compared and a winner is determined.
